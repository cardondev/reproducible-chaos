# CardonDev Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Security fixes, when provided, apply to the default branch only unless otherwise stated.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We do not accept vulnerability reports via email.

### GitHub Private Vulnerability Reporting

1. Go to the repository’s **Security** tab.
2. Choose **Report a vulnerability**.
3. Provide a clear description, impact assessment, and reproduction steps.

This is the only channel intended for non-public security disclosures.

We will close issues that include sensitive disclosure details and request a safer, reduced report.

## Coordinated Disclosure

If we validate a security issue, we may:
- Develop and release a fix on the default branch
- Credit the reporter (optional and only with consent)
- Publish a security advisory if appropriate

CardonDev does not offer bug bounties. 

## Safe Harbor

If you act in good faith to report a security issue through the channels above and avoid privacy violations, data destruction, or service disruption, we will not pursue action against you for the report itself.

## Response Targets

Best effort. Response times are not guaranteed.
